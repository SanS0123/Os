Step I:

Download java (JDK <latest version> - X64.tar.gz) by visiting the following link JavaSE Upgrade

(oracle.com)

Then jdk-7u71-linux-x64.tar.gz will be downloaded onto your system.

Step II:

Generally you will find the downloaded java file in the Downloads folder. Verify it and extract the

jdk-7u71-linux-x64.gz file using the following commands. $ cd Downloads/

$ ls

jdk-7u71-linux-x64.gz

$ tar zxf jdk-7u71-linux-x64.gz

$ ls

jdk1.7.0_71 jdk-7u71-linux-x64.gz

Step III:

To make java available to all the users,
you have to move it to the location “/usr/local/”. 
Open root, and type the following commands.

$ su

password:

# mv jdk1.7.0_71 /usr/local/

# exit

Step IV:

For setting up PATH and JAVA_HOME variables,
add the following commands to ~/.bashrc file.

export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/jdk1.7.0_71
export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin
Row apply all the changes into the current running system.
$ source ~/.bashrc

Step V:

Use the following commands to configure java alternatives:
# alternatives --install /usr/bin/java/java/usr/local/java/bin/java 2

# alternatives --install /usr/bin/javac/javac/usr/local/java/bin/javac 2

# alternatives --install /usr/bin/jar/jar/usr/local/java/bin/jar 2

# alternatives --setjava/usr/local/java/bin/java

# alternatives --set javac/usr/local/java/bin/javac

# alternatives --set jar/usr/local/java/bin/jar

Now verify the installation using the command java -version from the terminal as explained above.
